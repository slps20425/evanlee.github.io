Also, I have learned how to using an automated tool to reduce loading which provided from clients. During the validations on the testing tool from clients, I have more knowledge to trouble-shooting the tools, which required cross validation on device, regression testing between different version of the tools. Also, I have getting complete knowledge on each component inside the embedded device’s function, why it design to test and how the factory produce process run through. The most important is I have learned the independent during the period while I was staying in China. <br></br>
